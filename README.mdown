Jotdown
=======

Jotdown is a Markdown editor for the Apple iPad. Working on it, what little I can.

Known bugs
----------
- Saving is all wonky.
- Like, *really* wonky.
- Files are named with GUIDs, and that looks weird.
- Files are listed according to said GUIDs, so there's no ascertainable order to the file listing.
- The UI doesn't update as much as I'd like.

Feature List
------------
- More keyboard support
- Markdown syntax page
- Export to PDF

Jotdown is based on the C library "[Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/)", which also uses the BSD license. For some reason, I called it "libmarkdown" in the source.
